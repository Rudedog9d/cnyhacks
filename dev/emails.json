His father thinking that it was an important day for \nhis young lad, said to him, 'You can have anything that you want for \nyour birthday'. \nThe boy thought and thought. Finally, he said to his pop, \"Dad, I want a \ngreen golf ball.\" The man was surprised a bit, but decided to humour his son. \nAnd so, the boy recieved 1 green golf ball for his 10th birthday. \nOn this boy's 13th birthday, when he hit his teens, the father once again \nwalked up to the boy, and told him what he had before. The boy thought. And \nthought. Finally, he said, \"Dad, I want 10 green golf balls.\" Now, the father \nwas slightly curious about this, and he almost asked his son why. But then he \ndecided that it was just youthfulness, and left it at that. \nUpon graduating from High School, the boy was once again given that same \noffer by his father. He thought and thought and thought. Finally, he went up \nto his old man and said, \"Dad, I want 100 green golf balls.\" Now, the father \nwas very curious about this, and asked his son, finally, why he wanted the \nballs. The boy just said, \"Dad! It's a secret!\" The father backed down, and got \nthe boy his balls. \nWhen the boy graduated from college, his father once again offered him anything \nhe wanted. Once again, the boy thought. Once again, the boy walked up to his \nfather. He said, \"Dad, I want 1000 green golf balls.\" The father decided that \nthe boy knew how to live his life. But still he asked, \"Why, son? Why do you \nwant these green golf balls?\" And once again, the boy said,\"It's a secret, \nDad!\" \nAnd then came the war. And the boy volunteered himself for his country. And \nwhen he came back in one piece, his father said, \"Son, I will get you anything \nthat you want!\" And the boy thought. And thought. And he said, \"Dad, I want \n10,000 green golfballs.\" And the father could not hold back his question any \nlonger. \"Why? Why, son? Why do you need these green golf balls?\" And the son \nlooked at thim, and he said,\"Dad, now, I told you that it was a secret. Please \ndon't make me tell you.\" And the father backed off. \nThe boy got married. His father walked up to him, and offered him anything he \nwould want on this joyous occasion. The boy thought and thought and thought. \nAnd thought. And, finally, he said,\"Dad... I want 100,000 green golf balls...\" \nAnd the father, keeping calm, asked why. Why the boy wanted so many green golf \nballs. And all the boy could do was look at his father, and say,\"It's a \nsecret.\" And the father kept silent. \nThen, tragedy struck. There was a car accident. The boy was mortally injured. \nAnd the father went to see the son in his final hour. And he asked his son if \there was anything he could get him. And the son whispered,\"Father... Please \nget me 1,000,000 green golf balls...\" And the father almost wept. He said,\"Son, \nplease tell me why you want these green golf balls...\" And the son looked at \nhis father, and he said, \"Alright, dad...\" and then he died."
